# car-store-web-app

i have made this project by using three files. An file to make an blueprint of things a car needs when adding an car and get functions to get the falues your have enterd for that car. A file where I make use of an ArrayList to create the cars. And an jsp file where i put everything on screen.

the way that this application works is actually really simple. there are 2 java classes that you can use to get variables from and use them to create new variables. we have an application that in the beginning shows all of the cars in divs. it shows the picture, brand name, model name and price.

You also have a dropdown menu to filter it so it shows only that brand. There are 2 textFields, the first one is to select the minimum price of the cars you want to see and the other one is to set the maximum price of the cars you want to see. then you have a button that submits those parameters to the jsp file. the jsp file processes what parameters are given and than goes to the for and if, else statements to see what he can do with it. and if someone enters an invalid parameter in one of the textfields, it will give a error message.
